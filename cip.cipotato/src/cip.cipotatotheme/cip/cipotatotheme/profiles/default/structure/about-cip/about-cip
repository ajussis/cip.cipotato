<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.8555400993209332">The International Potato Center, known by its Spanish acronym CIP, was founded in 1971 as a root and tuber research-for-development institution delivering sustainable solutions to the pressing world problems of hunger, poverty, and the degradation of natural resources.  CIP is truly a global center, with headquarters in Lima, Peru and offices in 30 developing countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Working closely with our partners, CIP seeks to achieve food security, increased well-being, and gender equity for poor people in the developing world. CIP furthers its mission through rigorous research, innovation in science and technology, and capacity strengthening regarding root and tuber farming and food systems.</span><span></span><span></span></p>
<p><span>CIP is part of the 15-center research alliance known as the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (</span><a href="http://www.cgiar.org/"><span>CGIAR</span></a><span>). The CGIAR is a strategic global partnership dedicated to sustainable agricultural development and the preservation of our earth’s precious resources and biodiversity. Its aim is to reduce hunger, malnutrition, poverty, and environmental degradation in developing countries by generating and spreading agricultural knowledge, technologies, and policies. Donors include individual countries, major foundations, and international entities.</span></p>
