He has 20  years of  experience as a large-scale conventional and organic potato  farmer in  Ontario, Canada. Peter has a small, on-farm research program  that  develops varieties of potato with tolerance to scab and insects  and with  low reducing sugars after long-term storage. He is studying  how to grow  Asian sweetpotatoes in the temperate climate of Ontario.</span><br /><span> </span><br /><span>Previously,   Peter was employed by CIP in Central Africa (Rwanda) and served as   Regional Director in South East Asia (the Philippines). Since then,   Peter has consulted with numerous organizations and has been   particularly active with the Canadian Foodgrains Bank (CFGB) in   providing the necessary expertise in North Korea, Ethiopia, Burundi, and   Bangladesh.</span><br /><span> </span><br /><span>Peter  is honored to  share the challenges and opportunities that CIP faces  today. During a  time of global food insecurity, CIP is well positioned  to reduce  poverty and achieve food security because of its many  partnerships  around the world. Since becoming Board Chair in 2009, Peter  has been  active in the CGIAR reform process, including development of  the  Consortium Board and its functions.</span><br /><span> </span><br /><span>Peter   has published over 50 articles on potato research in refereed  journals,  most recently “Towards Sustainable Potato Production:  Experience with  Alternative Methods of Pest and Disease Control on a  Commercial Potato  Farm” (</span><span>American Journal of Potato Research</span><span>. 2010.  87: 428-433).</span></p>
