<p>COUNTRY: Kenya<br />EMAIL ADDRESS: j.landeo@cgiar.org | More information about Juan Landeos<br />DESCRIPTION</p>
<p><b>1) Promotion of late blight-resistant advanced clones among SSA countries.</b></p>
<p>CIP's breeding program at headquarters has already developed advanced late blight resistant breeding populations and oustanding clones in a variety of agro ecological zones similar to those in SSA potato production areas and elsewhere. Samples of these clones extensively tested for resistance to late blight, agronomic, productivity and quality traits for table and industry are being promoted in SSA countries for release of new varieties. Majority of national programs in SSA region are not able to sponsor a full breeding programs and indicated their preference to receive advanced clones from CIP although, in the long term they inetend to develop breeding programs to expand their capacity to cross breed, generate progenies and select locally. The project's strategy includes the introduction of disease-free in-vitro plants from CIP HQ to kenya through the Plant Quarantine Station (PQS) of KEPHIS (Kenyan Plant Health Inspectorate Service), production of minitubers and distribution to SSA countries in the region. Recipient countries also receive a multi-stakeholder accelerated participatory variety selection scheme (AVSS) to release varieties in 4 to 5 years and have at least 30 tm of clean basic seed to initiate variety diffusion.</p>
<p><b>2) Variety selection and diffusion of alreday released and new varieties from CIP's origin.</b></p>
<p>A new variety selection scheme based on extensively tested clones decribed above are being promoted in SSA countries to speed up the release of new varieties in shorter time than previous lengthy one. The scheme's strategy involves the release of varieties in 4 to 5 years, increase the rate of adoption by the participation of multi-stakeholders (farmers, taders, consumers and processors) and bulking seed through out the selection process of at least 30 tm at release time. Common bottle neck for variety diffusion in SSA countries is availability of clean seeds in suffcient amounts and adequate strategy. This project intends to strengthen national programs varity releases pipeline, capacity to produce pre basic and basic clean seed stocks of new and existing varieties and look into the private sector for involvement on sustainable larger scale pre basic and basic seed production to expand availability of seed supply for private seed suppliers and enhance diffusion of new varieties with increased qualities. New technologies for minituber production such as "aeroponics" are also being adapted and considered to increase the production rate per plant in 10- fold, lower the cost per tuber unit and reduce risk of soil borne diseases as it uses nutrient solution instead of soil substrates.</p>

<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br />Improved economic growth, livelihoods and enhanced quality of the environment in East Africa constitute the project’s goal while the purpose is to develop and utilize sustainable wetlands-compatible systems for increased productivity, health and reduced environmental pollution.<br />Background/Rationale:</p>
<p>Sweetpotato is increasingly becoming a major source of carbohydrates for the poor rural and urban dwellers in East Africa; particularly in the Lake Victoria zones of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda where the major food staples: bananas and cassava are increasingly succumbing to diseases. Faced with the chronic shortages of good quality planting material of improved varieties to improve food security and income needs of various end-users, farmers often resort to producing the crop from wetlands especially during the dry season, hence degrading the environment. This multidisciplinary research geared to meeting three major objectives namely:</p>
<p>(i) The development for potential on-farm and commercial applications, of wetland compatible methods/systems for the year-round production of quality sweetpotato planting material of improved varieties;</p>
<p>(ii) Investigating sweetpotato’s potential to trans-locate heavy metal pollutants in view of mitigating pollution; and</p>
<p>(iii) Investigating the suitability for human consumption of sweetpotatoes grown in polluted areas. Achieving these will, among others contribute to;</p>
<p>(a) Year-round on-farm production of quality planting material without affecting the wetlands in the three target countries: Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda</p>
<p>(b) Potential realization of a novel plant-based industrial system for water purification and recovery of metal pollutants for recycling, thus contributing to reduced environmental pollution and related health risks</p>
<p>(c) improved local capacity in staff and facilities to conduct and exploit integrated research on phytoremediation for industrial, health and environmental improvement in East Africa.<br /><br />PARTNER'S<br />1.

The project will focus on transfer and promotion of proven, available, and emerging technologies for the production, storage and processing of orange-fleshed sweetpotato into higher value products as well as providing market information, linking farmers to markets and the development of agro-enterprises. High yielding Vitamin A rich Varieties (OFSP) constitute one of the key technologies, as these significantly influence productivity and better nutrition. Success stories on impact of transferred technologies on the livelihoods of the poor people in the target areas will be translated into best practices or lessons learnt for broader scaling up and scaling out in the region. Technology transfer to farmers and end-users is conducted through a participatory approach involving concerned stakeholders, within participating countries, through applied and adaptive research using the Innovations Platform for Technology Adoption (IPTA) approach. The project is expected to culminate into several outputs including: the generation and promotion of best bet approaches for scaling up OFSP technologies; availing OFSP technologies for uptake pathways in target countries; strengthening of capacities for disseminating and scaling up of OFSP technologies in the production-to-consumption continuum; and availing information to intermediate and end users in ECA on best bet uptake approaches and OFSP technologies.<br /><br />PARTNER'S<br />1).Ethiopia: NARIs: Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR): Awassa Research Center; Ethiopian Nutrition and Health Research Institute , NGOs: CRS, WVI, Plan Ethiopia<br />Phone: + +255754 430675<br />2).

<p>PROJECT TITLE: Sweetpotato Technology Impact Assessment &amp; Enhancement<br />COUNTRY (LOCATION): Kenya &amp; Ethiopia<br />PERSON(S) RESPONSIBLE: Wachira Kaguongo<br />EMAIL ADDRESS: n.kaguongo@cgiar.org<br /><br />DESCRIPTION: Over the years CIP and its partners have invested in development and promotion of improved sweetpotato technologies, such as high yielding, virus resistant and orange flesh sweetpotato varieties (OFSP). The CIP’s impact enhancement division conducts adoption and impact studies to evaluate the effectiveness of these development and promotion efforts. The objectives of adoption and impact studies for Kenya and Ethiopia include documentation of economic impact of the development and promotion efforts, drawing lessons from the studies in regard to the effectiveness of variety development and promotion strategies in the three countries, identifying key factors for successful variety introduction to give fed back to the sweetpotato breeding and variety selection programs of CIP and its research partners.<br /><br />The studies start with rapid appraisal to map out the major sweetpotato growing areas, understand the key players and have a general overview of strength, weaknesses, opportunities and threats in sweetpotato sector of each country. During reconnaissance surveys sweetpotato farmers, key informants and stakeholders provide relevant information for the study. Rapid appraisal is followed by baseline and adoption studies which involve interviewing randomly sampled farmers from major sweetpotato growing districts in each country using structured questionnaires which allow in-depth evaluation of adoption patterns, seed systems, market preference, and impact of improved sweetpotato technologies.<br /><br />PARTNER(s)<br />1.

The project aims at increasing adoption, commercialization and consumption of Orange Flesh Traditional Foods project is implemented in Kiambu, Kabondo and Busia in Kenya and Arusha in Tanzania. The project aims at increasing adoption, commercialization and consumption of Orange Flesh Sweetpotatoes (OFSP) and Traditional African Vegetables (TAVs) and evaluating the effectiveness of the process of the Commercial Village (VA) approach in improving incomes, increasing micronutrient intake, and other indicators of well-being of all players and their families along the value chain. A Commercial Villages (CV) approach is a concept that involves commercialization of various farmer groups clustered in a village to ensure that highest numbers of members of a village are practicing commercial farming. In this approach farmers are organized into Markets Support Units (MSUs). An MSU is a group of farmers who are evolved from the social orientation and their capacity built to become a commercial unit which can effectively and consistently market their produce as a group.<br /><br />The role of impact enhancement division in TF project is monitoring and evaluation of project implementation and measuring and documenting effectiveness and impact of the project and Commercial Village Approach. Monitoring and evaluation activities involve regular field visits by monitoring team to take audit of activities, outputs and outcomes of project implementation. Engendered baseline and impact surveys of producers, traders and consumers and focus group discussions are among the studies and approaches used to evaluate adoption and impact of improved sweetpotato and TAVS technologies, production practices, consumption of nutrient rich crops and increased market access.<br /><br />PARTNER(s)<br />1.

The project aims at increasing adoption, commercialization and consumption of Orange Flesh Traditional Foods project is implemented in Kiambu, Kabondo and Busia in Kenya and Arusha in Tanzania. The project aims at increasing adoption, commercialization and consumption of Orange Flesh Sweetpotatoes (OFSP) and Traditional African Vegetables (TAVs) and evaluating the effectiveness of the process of the Commercial Village (VA) approach in improving incomes, increasing micronutrient intake, and other indicators of well-being of all players and their families along the value chain. A Commercial Villages (CV) approach is a concept that involves commercialization of various farmer groups clustered in a village to ensure that highest numbers of members of a village are practicing commercial farming. In this approach farmers are organized into Markets Support Units (MSUs). An MSU is a group of farmers who are evolved from the social orientation and their capacity built to become a commercial unit which can effectively and consistently market their produce as a group.<br /><br />The role of impact enhancement division in TF project is monitoring and evaluation of project implementation and measuring and documenting effectiveness and impact of the project and Commercial Village Approach. Monitoring and evaluation activities involve regular field visits by monitoring team to take audit of activities, outputs and outcomes of project implementation. Engendered baseline and impact surveys of producers, traders and consumers and focus group discussions are among the studies and approaches used to evaluate adoption and impact of improved sweetpotato and TAVS technologies, production practices, consumption of nutrient rich crops and increased market access.<br /><br />PARTNER'S<br />1.

<p>PROJECT TITLE: Combating HIV/AIDS in urban communities through food and nutrition security: the role of women led micro-livestock enterprises and horticultural production in Nakuru town.<br /><br />COUNTRY(LOCATION): Nakuru Municipality, Kenya.<br /><br />PERSON REPSONSIBLE: Principal investigators; Prof. Nancy Karanja - Urban Harvest Regional Coordinator SSA, Prof. Fiona Yeudall - School of Nutrition Ryerson University Canada.<br /><br />CONTACT EMAIL ADDRESS: nancy.karanja@cgiar.org , fyeudall@ryerson.ca<br /><br />PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br />Introduction: In 2006, a consortium of agricultural research organizations, self-help groups, CBOs, health care providers, municipal policy makers and donors established an innovative partnership to build capacity for urban agriculture (UA) among PLWHAs in Nakuru, Kenya.<br />Lessons learned: In early 2007, we conducted a baseline survey of livelihoods and food and nutrition security status faced by154 Households with at least one PLWHA and one child 2 -5. Households commonly experienced severe food shortage (77%), eviction (37%), hospitalization (34%), job loss (26%), and/or death of an adult (17%). Female headed Households (45.2 % ) reported more crises (mean 2.83, 95% CI 2.52-3.13) compared to male headed Households (mean 2.10, 95% CI 1.80-2.40), more illness over the last month (67.1% versus 57.1%), greater perceived lack of medical care (50% versus 40%) and less access to land for farming (22.9% versus 44.7% ). While 33.1% of the children were stunted with 26.0% underweight. Food insecurity assessment showed that a mere 0.6% of the households were food secure; of the remainder 1.9% were mildly food insecure, 24.0% moderately food insecure and 73.4% severely food insecure.<br />Intervention:Since baseline, SEHTUA (Sustainable Environments and Health through Urban Agriculture) partners have provided training, starter seedlings, land access (for those from extremely poor neighbourhoods) and other inputs for production of African Indigenous and conventional vegetables. Consensus at self-help group meetings indicates improved access to vegetables for consumption and positive economic returns from local sale. Self-selected Households are raising dairy goats screened for illness prior to introduction and growing feed (sweet potato vines, Napier grass, and fruit and vegetable wastes from the market).<br />Next steps: Close monitoring and evaluation is on-going and should provide insights into pathways by which crop and livestock production can impact livelihood, food intake, and nutrition security status of HIV/AIDS affected HH. We will assess during follow up whether availability of goat milk provides safe infant feeding options for mothers with HIV/AIDS, an animal source food for young children, and earnings from sale.<br /><br />PARTNERS<br />Urban Harvest the international Potato Centre<br />Ryerson University School of Nutrition<br />University of Toronto Centre for Urban Health Initiatives<br />Badili Mawazo Self Help Group<br />Presbyterean Church of East Africa (PCEA) Nakuru West Parish<br />Ministry of Agriculture<br />Ministry of Livestock and fisheries<br />Ministry of Health<br />University of Nairobi<br />Egerton University<br />International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI)<br />Municipal Council of Nakuru (MCN).<br /><br />START DATE: Jul-06<br />DURATION: 3 YEARS<br /><br />DONORS: Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)<br /><br />LINKS<br />1) https://my.ryerson.ca.<br />2) Nakuru Canada-CGIAR Linkage project.<br /><br />RELEVANT PUBLICATIONS<br />Natasha A.

<p>PROJECT TITLE: Orange-fleshed sweetpotato for alleviating vitamin A deficiency in sub-Saharan Africa<br /><br />COUNTRY (LOCATION): Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Ghana, South Africa, Mozambique, Nigeria, Zambia, Ethiopia and Madagascar<br /><br />PERSON(S) RESPONSIBLE: Regina Kapinga and Wolfgang Gruneberg<br /><br />EMAIL ADDRESS: r.kapinga@cgiar.org; w.gruneberg@cgiar.org<br /><br />PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br />The project of part of the wider goal under Harvest Plus challenge program to reduce micronutrient malnutrition among poor populations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The intermediate goal is to develop and disseminate beta-carotene dense varieties of sweet potato. Purpose: To improve the β-carotene content of the diet of micronutrient deficient populations in selected countries. Through the project life, activities have mainly been implemented under five themes.<br /><br />a) Population development - where breeding populations have been generated through regional crossing blocks in Uganda, South Africa and Zambia as well as in country crossing blocks in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Ghana. Additional breeding populations have been introduced in the regions from CIP HQ Lima. Also local accessions have been collected and characterised in most countries. In all countries, clonal evaluation and preliminary yield evaluations have been done to select the promising lines for further selection levels.<br />b) Adaptability and acceptability studies through farmer participatory Research - Advanced materials have been tested at advanced, multilocation and on farm trial studies in different countries leading to many variety releases.<br />c) Diversity, heritability and molecular studies for Iron, Zinc and ather nutrients -- Most of the work was conducted in collaboration with Louisiana State University. Related activities are being undertaken in Uganda under a PhD program with Makerere Univeristy.<br />d) Multiplication of basic planting materials --- Under this theme all countries every year ensured at least 1 ha of clean planting material for the released varieties to give out to NGO and CBO partners for dissemination.<br />e) Capacity building --- Different short courses, attachments and workshops heve been orgarnised for partners to enhance capacity especially in areas of sweetpotato breeding experimentation, data collection and analysis. Also degree research activities in sweetpotato breeding have been cosupervised with a number of universities in the region.<br /><br />PARTNER'S<br />1.

Therefore, the specific objectives include: i). To assess the influence of environment on β-carotene levels among the promising orange-fleshed sweetpotato varieties in Uganda. ii) To assess the effect of time of harvesting, on ß-carotene content of the promising orange-fleshed sweetpotato varieties in Uganda. Experiments were conducted in three different agro-ecologies of Uganda. The research covered in this project represents an expansion of the scope of activities under the HarvestPlus – sweetpotato breeding activities and is directly related to activities of the Reaching End Users project for dissemination of orange-fleshed sweetpotato varieties in Uganda. Results obtained showed that the best time for harvesting OFSP is 5 months after planting when beta-carotene contents have accummulated to maximum. Also there is Genotype by Environment interaction on the beta-carotene accummulation. The best yileds of beta-carotene contents was obtained from warm, humid and mid-altitude environment and the lowest beta-caroeten accummulation is obatained in the higher and cold environments.<br /><br />PARTNER(s)<br />1.
