<p class="style8">The International Potato Center (known by its  Spanish  acronym, CIP) seeks to reduce poverty and achieve food security  on a  sustained basis in developing countries through scientific research  and  related activities on potato, sweetpotato, other root and tuber  crops,  and on the improved management of natural resources in the Andes  and  other mountain areas.</p>
<p class="style8">CIP headquarters are in Lima,  Peru and its regional headquarters  in SSA are in Nairobi, Kenya.  CIP  scientists are also based in Uganda,  Malawi, Mozambique, Angola, and  Benin.  Our efforts in the region are  focused on research for  development to combat vitamin A deficiency  through the effective  deployment of pro-vitamin A rich, orange-fleshed  sweetpotatoes and to  combat poverty and food insecurity utilizing  late-blight resistant  potato varieties.</p>

The project, entitled Sweetpotato Action for Security and Health in   Africa (SASHA), will be implemented in eight Sub-Saharan African   countries, and is supported by a five-year, $21 million grant from the   Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.</span> <b><span class="style8"><a class="internal-link" href="cip_sasha-pressreleasefinal-approved-by-bmgf-word-2003">Read More</a></span></b></p>

The Minister for Agriculture, Honourable William   arap Ruto(pictured), toured the booth. He was intrigued by the different   characteristics of the potato clones which were on display and which   are currently being tested under national performance trials in Kenya.   Dr.Ian Barker Head of Seed Systems at CIP and Sammy Agili a Sweet potato   breeder at CIP explained to him that the top quality potatoes on   display were new varieties grown in Kenya, from seed produced in Kenya.<a href="http://www.cipotato.org/regions/CIP-SSA/Activities/All%20Africa%20Horticulture/Congress%20Notes.doc" target="_blank"> </a><b><a class="internal-link" href="congress-notes">Read More</a></b></p>
<p class="style50">GTZ Adaptation to climate change project TOA - Minimum  Data modeling workshop 24-26 June 2009, ILRI campus, Nairobi, Kenya.</p>
<p align="left"><span class="style8"><img alt="Participants" class="image-left" src="wshopParticipants.jpg" />In the context of the GTZ/BMZ   funded project 'Participatory development and testing of strategies to   reduce climate vulnerability of poor farm households in East Africa   through innovations in potato and sweet potato technologies and enabling   policies', CIP organized a three day workshop at the ILRI campus in   Nairobi last week (24-26 June). Participants included researchers from   the three project countries (Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia) as well as CIP   scientists and professors from universities in the Netherlands and the   US. Information on stakeholder meetings held in the study areas last   year as well as survey data currently being collected for the project   were shared and methodologies to ex ante test  adaptation strategies in   the context of climate change were introduced. <a href="http://www.cipotato.org/regions/CIP-SSA/Activities/Lieven%27s%20workshop/Full%20report.doc" target="_blank"><b>Read More</b></a></span></p>
