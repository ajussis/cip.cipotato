<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.7944435357503107">CIP’s  earthquake-proof genebank features state-of-the-art conservation  chambers, laboratories, and distribution facilities. CIP uses a range of  methods to protect the collections in its care.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Field  genebank. Potato varieties kept as tubers are propagated annually in  CIP’s field genebank at Huancayo, located 3,200 meters above sea level  in the Peruvian Andes, for characterization and evaluation purposes. The  sweetpotato collection is kept as living plants in greenhouses.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>In  vitro conservation. Potato plantlets are kept for up to two years in  test tubes in a sterilized, semi-solid culture medium that provides all  the nutrients the plants need. A temperature of 6-8°C, low light, and an  osmotic regulator slow their growth. When re-planted under normal light  and temperature conditions, the plantlets grow normally. Sweetpotato  plantlets are maintained similarly. CIP’s in vitro genebank is the  world’s largest.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>True  seed conservation. Kept at around –20°C, the tiny seed from the  berry-like fruit of potato are by far the cheapest and easiest kind of  material to store, as its lifespan is about 40 years. However, unlike  asexually (clonally) propagated tubers, the genetic make-up of  cross-pollinated seed is unpredictable. Sweetpotato seed is kept with  equal success. </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Cryopreservation.  Shoot tips are deep-frozen in a tissue-protecting solution at –196°C in  vials of liquid nitrogen. At this temperature, all cellular functions  theoretically cease, making it possible to keep plant material  indefinitely and later revive it. The technology is now well advanced  for potato but is still being developed for sweetpotato.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>DNA  conservation. DNA of more than 2,400 varieties of the germplasm  collection has been extracted and kept in deep-freeze at –70°C. The goal  is to conserve all samples in this manner in the future.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Herbarium.  CIP’s herbarium houses around 25,000 specialized specimens of potato,  sweetpotato, and the Andean roots and tubers, a result of the life-long  labors of the famous Peruvian scientist Professor Carlos Ochoa.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>In  situ-ex situ conservation. CIP collaborates with Andean farming  communities to establish community genebanks by repatriating  disease-free potato seed to grow on communal land. This approach means  that the natural processes of evolution and selection in response to  changing conditions continue to operate on the plants in their  environments. At harvest time, the farmers help themselves to tubers  that they will use to grow their next crop and to distribute to  neighboring communities. An example is CIP’s work at the Potato Park in  Pisaq, Cusco, Peru, with six communities and Asociación Andes, a local  NGO.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Black  box conservation: For added security, CIP maintains a duplicate set of  its in vitro collections at another site outside Peru, and in the seed  collection at the Svalbard Seed Vault in Norway.</span></p>
