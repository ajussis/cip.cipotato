<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.6633268743753433">[Tagline] Conserving genetic diversity</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Genebanks conserve living samples of the world’s huge diversity of crop varieties and their wild relatives. They ensure that the genetic resources that underpin our food supply are both secure in the long term and available for use by farmers, plant breeders, and researchers. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>CIP is committed to ensuring the safety and conservation of the world’s potato and sweetpotato gene pool in its entirety and to promoting the effective use of this priceless resource for future generations.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The CIP genebank holds over 80% of the world’s native potato and sweetpotato cultivars and over 80% of the known species of wild potato. It also maintains more than 1,500 accessions of Andean roots and tubers. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Maintained as global pubic goods under the U.N. International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, CIP’s germplasm is available for free to developing countries. It is used in breeding programs in over 100 countries.</span><span></span></p>
<p><b><span>A living collection - a worldwide resource</span></b><span></span></p>
<p><span>Germplasm accessions, containing the genetic blueprints of potato, sweetpotato, and nine other Andean root and tuber crops, are carefully preserved, maintained, and catalogued. Comprehensive information is available for scientists via an online database, the first of its kind to apply bioinformatics to a genebank collection. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>CIP is custodian of the world’s largest in vitro genebank, the first to obtain International Standards Organization (ISO) accreditation for safe and secure germplasm movement. In continuous operation for nearly 40 years, the genebank maintains clonal and seed collections and houses one of the world’s leading herbarium collections. </span><span></span></p>
<p><b><span>From the genebank to the farmer’s field: how biodiversity is used</span><span></span></b></p>
<p><span>Extensive screening of thousands of individual accessions of wild and cultivated potato species from the Andes has helped scientists identify resistance to important potato diseases and pests. Tolerance to frost, drought, and salinity have also been identified. In sweetpotato, varieties with greater beta-carotene content, better disease resistance, and higher salt and drought tolerance are being developed. These varieties will be ideal for cultivation in Africa and in many other places in the world.</span><span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span><span>Links</span><br /><span></span><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/cgxchange.org/document/d/1hZ76S8z3DjCj2Bu5W-ElnBvUJdVa70wnLFLJa_S8oCI/edit?hl=en#bookmark=id.6u6zsf-tgib1a"><span>Ordering germplasm</span></a><span></span><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/cgxchange.org/document/d/1hZ76S8z3DjCj2Bu5W-ElnBvUJdVa70wnLFLJa_S8oCI/edit?hl=en#bookmark=id.1ec88n-bqru2h"><span>Conservation methods</span></a><span></span><br /><span>Breeding</span><br /><span>CIP &amp; biodiversity</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>World Potato Atlas [</span><a href="https://research.cip.cgiar.org/confluence/display/wpa/Home"><span>https://research.cip.cgiar.org/confluence/display/wpa/Home</span></a><span>]</span><br /><span>World Sweetpotato Atlas </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/cgxchange.org/document/d/1hZ76S8z3DjCj2Bu5W-ElnBvUJdVa70wnLFLJa_S8oCI/edit?hl=en"><span>[https://research.cip.cgiar.org/confluence/display/wsa/Home]</span></a><span></span><br /><span>Other?</span><br /><span></span><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/cgxchange.org/document/d/1hZ76S8z3DjCj2Bu5W-ElnBvUJdVa70wnLFLJa_S8oCI/edit?hl=en#bookmark=id.fpa7pd-2x052d"><span>Ruta Cóndor</span></a><span></span><br /><a href="http://www.rootsforlife.org/"><span>Roots for Life</span></a></p>
