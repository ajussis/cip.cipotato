<p><span>Screening thousands of individual accessions of wild and cultivated potato species from the Andes has helped scientists identify resistance to the important potato diseases and pests in developing countries. Greater tolerance to frost, drought, and salinity is being explored. Sweetpotato varieties with higher beta-carotene content, better disease resistance, and greater salt and drought tolerance are being developed. These varieties will be ideal for cultivation in Africa and in many other places in the developing world.</span></p>
