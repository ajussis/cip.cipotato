<p id="internal-source-marker_0.7944435357503107" style="text-align: justify; "><span>CIP’s  Ruta Cóndor project aims to restore and conserve the genetic diversity  of native potatoes in their centers of origin. The cultivars were  collected from Andean farming communities 20-40 years ago and conserved  in CIP’s ex-situ genebank.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span>The  objective is to restore lost native potato cultivars and improve  diversity, which has been affected by frost, drought, crop pests and  diseases, human migrations, and poverty. CIP ensures that re-introduced  planting material is high quality and disease-free, thus increasing  yields.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span>CIP  started repatriating native potatoes in 1998. Since then, it has  reintroduced over 3,600 samples of more than 1,200 varieties of native  potato in 41 Andean farms and has worked with potato farmers to find  commercial outlets and marketing opportunities for native potatoes.</span></p>
