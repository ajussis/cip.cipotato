<h2><span>Mixing in-situ and ex-situ conservation</span></h2>
<p><span><img alt="Ruta Condor map" class="image-right" height="371" src="MapRutacondor.jpg" width="268" />Ruta Cóndor - literally “route of the condor” - spans the Andean highlands from Venezuela to Argentina. Native potatoes originated in agricultural pockets throughout this region. Today, many native cultivars have been lost due to frost, drought, crop pests and diseases, human migration, and poverty. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The Ruta Cóndor project aims to restore and conserve the genetic diversity of native potatoes in their centers of origin. The project includes repatriating native cultivars collected from Andean farming communities 20-40 years ago and conserved in CIP’s ex-situ genebank. CIP ensures that reintroduced planting material is high quality and disease free, thus increasing farmers’ yields.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>CIP started repatriating native potatoes in 1998. Since then, it has reintroduced over 3,600 accessions of more than 1,200 native potato varieties to 41 Andean farms. In addition, CIP has worked with potato farmers to find commercial outlets and marketing opportunities for native potatoes.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The goal is to establish microconservation centers along the Ruta Cóndor similar to the </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/cgxchange.org/document/d/1hZ76S8z3DjCj2Bu5W-ElnBvUJdVa70wnLFLJa_S8oCI/edit?hl=en#bookmark=id.olubobwxfzqu"><span>Potato Park</span></a><span> in Pisaq, Peru.</span><span></span></p>
<p class="callout"><b>In-situ versus ex-situ conservation. </b>In-situ (on site) conservation protects an endangered species in its natural habitat, either by protecting or cleaning up the habitat itself or by defending the species from predators. In terms of to agricultural biodiversity, in-situ conservation pertains to farmers and often unconventional farming practices. Maintaining an endangered species in the surrounding where it has developed its distinctive properties helps ensure the ongoing processes of evolution and adaptation within its environment. By constrast, ex-situ (off site) conservation protects an endangered species outside of its natural habitat.</p>
