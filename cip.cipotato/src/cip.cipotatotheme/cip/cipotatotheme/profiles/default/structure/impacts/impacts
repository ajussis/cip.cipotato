<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.9392764449585229">Agricultural research for development in the twenty first century is an important part of the solution to the formidable challenges facing developing. Problems such as rising food prices,  scarce resources, volatile global financial markets, climate change, and emerging pests and diseases. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>With root and tuber crop systems in the past often under-resourced and under-utilized, CIP’s research on potato and sweetpotato has been impacting science,  production systems and people, since its foundation in 1971.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Today with regional offices and project activities in some 60 locations across Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America, CIP receives funding from over 55 international donors, and   economic benefits from improved production as a result of CIP’s work to date amount to more than a billion US dollars, the greater part of which has benefited the world’s poorest populations.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Positive impacts also reach far beyond financial gains. They can be measured in terms of human, social, physical and natural livelihood assets.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Anticipated impacts are what drive CIP’s research, and projects are planned strategically around them to ensure that we can meet our goals and effect real change in people’s lives. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Current research priorities were established by a rigorous targeting exercise, and are guided by this comprehensive and layered analysis of where and what research can best help fight hunger and poverty.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>To ensure a focus on impact, CIP research is guided by impact pathways, best-bet descriptions of how research will ultimately affect the livelihoods of people. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The Participatory Impact Pathway Approach (PIPA) is a people centered, practical approach to planning, monitoring and evaluating complex research for development projects. Stakeholders working together to formulate  project products, outcomes and impacts means that science stays on track, and researchers consider not only where we are going but the complex human relationships that have a crucial bearing on how we get there. </span></p>
