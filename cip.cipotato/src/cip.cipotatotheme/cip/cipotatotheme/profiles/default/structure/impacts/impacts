<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.49501763051375747">Agricultural research for development is an important part of the solution to the challenges facing today’s developing countries: scarce resources, volatile global financial markets, unprecedented climate change, and emerging pests and diseases. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>CIP’s research on potato and sweetpotato has been impacting science and people, since its foundation in 1971.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>With regional offices and project activities in some 60 locations across Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America, economic benefits from improved production as a result of CIP’s work to date amount to more than a billion US dollars.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Positive impacts also reach far beyond financial gains. They can be measured in terms of human, social, physical and natural livelihood assets.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Anticipated impacts drive CIP’s research. Projects are planned strategically around them to ensure that we can meet our goals and effect real change in people’s lives. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Current research priorities, established by a rigorous targeting exercise, are guided by a comprehensive and layered analysis of where and what research can best help fight hunger and poverty.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>CIP’s projects are guided by impact pathways; best-bet descriptions of how projects will ultimately affect the livelihoods of people. Mapping and monitoring the pathway involves a process which brings researchers together with the people on the ground who make the projects work, as well as those who benefit, to ensure that science stays on track. </span><span></span></p>
