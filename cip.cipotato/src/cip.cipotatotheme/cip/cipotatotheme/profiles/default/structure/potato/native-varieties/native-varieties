<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.0050882757641375065">Over 4,000 varieties of native potatoes grow in the Andean highlands of Peru, Boliva, and Ecuador. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Selected over centuries for their taste, texture, shape and color, these potato varieties are very</span><br /><span>well adapted to the harsh conditions that prevail in the high Andes, at altitudes ranging from 3,500 to 4,200 meters. Farmers generally produce these native varieties with minimal or no use of agrochemicals.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Diversity is conserved on farms and in communities for subsistence use and as a highly valued heritage. Most of these varieties never see a market; they are traded among highland and lowland communities and given as gifts for weddings and other occasions. The varieties differ from community to community.</span><span></span></p>

The tubers grew well in the cold, harsh climate and quickly took root as a centerpiece around which life revolved.</span></p>
