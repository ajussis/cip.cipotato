<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.5605579006951302">Potatoes are an excellent, low-fat source of carbohydrates, with one-fourth the calories of bread. Boiled, they have more protein than maize and nearly twice the calcium. An average serving of potatoes with the skin on provides about 10 percent of the recommended daily intake of fiber.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>When boiled, a single medium-sized potato contains about half the daily adult requirement of vitamin C, as well as significant amounts of iron, potassium and zinc. Potato also contains substantial amounts of vitamin B and valuable supplies of essential trace elements, such as manganese, chromium, selenium and molybdenum. The high vitamin C content enhances iron absorption.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Potato can have white, yellow, pink, red, purple, and even blue flesh. Yellow flesh is primarily due to the presence of carotenoids, and red, purple, and blue flesh, to anthocyanins. Both are antioxidants and believed to play an important role in preventing cancer and diseases related to ageing. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Potato leaves, sprouts, and stems have toxic components known as glycoalkaloids, which are meant to protect the plant against fungi and insects. Glycoalkaloids can be removed by peeling and cutting away the green areas.</span></p>
