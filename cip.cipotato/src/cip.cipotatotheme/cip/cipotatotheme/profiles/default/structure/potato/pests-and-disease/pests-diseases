<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.5605579006951302">Increasing potato production while protecting producers, consumers, and the environment requires an </span><span>integrated approach</span><span> encompassing a range of strategies: encouraging natural pest predators, breeding varieties with pest/disease resistance, planting clean seed, rotating with other crops, and organic composting to improve soil quality.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Some of potatoâ€™s enemies.</span><br /><span></span><br /><b><span>Diseases</span><span></span><br /></b><span>Late blight</span><span>, the most serious potato disease worldwide, is caused by a water mould, </span><span>Phytophthora infestans</span><span>, that destroys leaves, stems, and tubers. </span><br /><span>Bacterial wilt</span><span>, caused by the bacterial pathogen, leads to severe losses in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Potato blackleg</span><span>, a bacterial infection, causes tubers to rot in the ground and in storage.</span><br /><span>Viruses </span><span>are disseminated in tubers and can cut yields by 50 percent.</span><br /><span></span><br /><b><span>Pests</span><br /></b><span>Colorado potato beetle </span><span>(</span><span>Leptinotarsa decemlineata</span><span>) is a serious pest with strong resistance to insecticides.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Potato tuber moth</span><span>, most commonly </span><span>Phthorimaea operculella</span><span>, is the most damaging pest of planted and stored potatoes in warm, dry areas.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Leafminer fly </span><span>(</span><span>Liriomyza huidobrensis</span><span>) is a South American native common in areas where insecticides are used intensively.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Cyst nematodes </span><span>(</span><span>Globodera pallida </span><span>and </span><span>G. rostochiensis</span><span>) are serious soil pests in temperate regions, the Andes, and other highland areas.</span></p>
