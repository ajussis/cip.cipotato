<p><span>Potato is the third most important food crop in the world after rice and wheat in terms of human consumption. More than a billion people worldwide eat potato, and global total crop production exceeds 300 million metric tons.</span><span></span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Potato is a critical crop in terms of food security in the face of population growth and increased hunger rates. For example, China, the world’s biggest consumer of potatoes, expects that fully 50% of the increased food production it will need to meet demand in the next 20 years will come from potatoes.</span><span></span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The first modern “convenience food,” potato is energy-rich, nutritious, easy to grow on small plots, cheap to purchase, and ready to cook without expensive processing.</span><span></span><span></span></p>
<p><span>CIP’s genebank maintains the largest collection of potato in the world, including more than 7,000 accessions of native, wild, and improved varieties. </span></p>
