<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.5605579006951302">There are about 5,000 edible varieties of potato, mostly found in the Andes of South America. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Potato is nutritious, cheap, and widely available. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Potato is the third most important food crop in the world after rice and wheat in terms of human consumption. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The potato produces more nutritious food more quickly, on less land, and in harsher climates than any other major crop--up to 85% of the plant is edible human food, compared to around 50% in cereals.</span><br /><span></span></p>
<p><span>Potatoes can grow from sea level up to 4,700 meters above sea level; from southern Chile</span><span> to Greenland. They are produced in over 100 countries worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Potato was the first modern "convenience food": energy-rich, nutritious, easy to grow on small plots, cheap to purchase, and ready to cook without expensive processing.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>More than a billion people worldwide eat potato, and global total crop production exceeds 300 million metric tons.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>CIP maintains the largest collection of potato in the world, including more than 7,000 accessions of native, wild, and improved varieties. </span></p>
