<div>The CGIAR Research Programs (CRPs) are major programs of research  reaching across the CGIAR Centers and their partners, They are organised  under seven thematic areas as defined by the CGIAR Consortium's  Strategy and Results Framework (SRF).  These CRPs are strategic, and are  designed to bring together relevant stakeholders on all  research-related activities ranging from bidding for funds, through  planning, implementation, monitoring and coordinating, to synthesising  outputs and communicating results. They are the cornerstone of the CGIAR  reform, in that they represent a shift to a strategic priority- and  results-driven research agenda.</div>
