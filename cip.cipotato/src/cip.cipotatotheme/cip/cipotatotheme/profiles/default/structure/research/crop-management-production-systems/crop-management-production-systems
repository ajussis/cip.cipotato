<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.635411890456453">Increasing production while protecting producers, consumers, and the environment requires a holistic approach encompassing a range of strategies: encouraging natural pest predators, breeding varieties with pest/disease resistance, planting clean seed, rotation with other crops, and organic composting to improve soil quality.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Integrated crop management (ICM) combines expertise across CIP to develop scientific knowledge and best practices related to seed, agronomy, soil, diseases, and insects. The aim is to develop principles, strategies, and methods that can be adapted by national agricultural research (NAR) centers and adopted by farmers in developing countries. </span><span></span></p>
<h2><span>Quality seed</span><span></span></h2>
<p><span>Clean seed is the cornerstone of ICM for both potato and sweetpotato. Improving the availability of, and access to, quality seed for smallholder farmers and improving formal and informal seed distribution is the main focus. Efforts to enhance methods for rapid, cost-effective multiplication of seed are combined with interventions to improve farmer-based seed systems.</span></p>
<h2><span></span><span>Disease management</span><span></span></h2>
<p><span>Potato and sweetpotato diseases, such as late blight, bacterial wilt, and viruses, cause serious losses to farmers around the world. CIP is working to find solutions to these problems, develop technologies suitable for poor farmers, and assess the risks due to changes in pathogens, populations, climate, and cropping systems.</span><span></span></p>
<h2><span>Integrated pest management</span><span></span></h2>
<p><span>IPM aims at maintaining pest populations at acceptable levels and keeping pesticides and other interventions to levels that are economically justified and safe for human health and the environment. IPM methods developed by CIP are helping farmers reduce losses caused by major potato and sweetpotato pests.</span><span></span></p>
<h2><span>Production systems</span><span></span></h2>
<p><span>How do potato and sweetpotato feed into the larger biophysical landscape (cropping systems, soil and water management, livestock, etc.), particularly in light of climate change? These complex relationships are the focus of CIP research in resource-poor farming communities.</span></p>
