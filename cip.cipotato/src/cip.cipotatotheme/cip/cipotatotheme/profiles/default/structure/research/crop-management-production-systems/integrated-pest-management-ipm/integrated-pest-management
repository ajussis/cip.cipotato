<p>The use of chemical pesticides on potato and sweetpotato is increasing in developing countries, as farmers intensify production and expand cultivation into areas and planting seasons beyond the crop's traditional range. The chemicals used are frequently highly toxic and applied with little or no protective equipment. And they are expensive: developing countries spend about US $300 million per year on pesticides for potato alone.</p>
<p>IPM aims to maintain pest populations at acceptable levels and keep pesticides and other interventions to levels that are economically justified and safe for human health and the environment.</p>
<p>CIP research focuses on understanding factors that influence the distribution and population dynamics of pests; developing models to assess pest risks under climate change and intensified cropping; designing and evaluating IPM components, particularly focusing on biological controls; understanding how technologies perform “in the field’; and defining strategies to scale up IPM.</p>
<p class="callout">Biological  controls use living organisms, such as parasitoids,  nematodes, and  fungi, to control pests, diseases, and weeds that attack  crops.</p>
