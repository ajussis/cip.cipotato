<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.30517161288298666">Two CIP-designed products may help reduce the indiscriminate use of pesticides against species of the potato tuber moth.</span></p>
<h2><span id="internal-source-marker_0.30517161288298666"> </span><span>Attracticide</span></h2>
<p><span> </span><span>The </span><span>attracticide </span><span>is a formula based on sex pheromones and very low concentrations of contact insecticides (16 to 30 times less than normal applications). For use in both field and storage, it provides good control against tuber moth species </span><i><span>Phthorimaea operculella</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Symmetrischema tangolias</span></i><span>, which can drastically affect crop yield and quality. Field tests have shown up to 90% reduction in the male population of both species. Damage to stored tubers has decreased by up to 90%. The formula also significantly affects reproduction and fertility in the females.</span></p>
<h2><span>Bt powder<br /></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span> </span></p>
<p><i><span>Bacillus thurengesis </span></i><span>(Bt) powder</span><span>, a reformulation of the commercial product Dipel, combines a soil bacteria widely used in agriculture with a silicate-type powder. It has proven effective in the control of potato moth species </span><span><i>S. tangolias</i>, <i>Phtorimaea operculella</i></span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>and</span><span> <i>Tecia solanivora</i></span><span>. </span></p>
