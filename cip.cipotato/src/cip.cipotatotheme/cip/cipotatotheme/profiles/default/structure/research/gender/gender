<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.16611889232116206">Investing in women - key players for ensuring impact</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Women  play a critical role in producing root and tuber crops. They are also  the decision makers in families and communities regarding health and  nutrition, and keepers of a wealth of knowledge surrounding crop  production and benefits. </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Women  often work in difficult conditions, receiving little recognition for  their efforts. With agricultural research and extension services  previously broadly directed at men, there has traditionally been a  marked difference in the benefits received by men and women. Not only is  it time that women have a fair share in both the burdens and benefits  of their labor, by excluding them we risk losing the chance to tap into  the mighty potential of one of the developing world’s major assets </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>(Sidebar)  “ Sustainable agriculture, rural development and food security cannot  be acheived through efforts that ignore or exclude more than half of the  rural population - women” (FAO)</span><br /><span>Closing  the gender gap was one of the key impact issues highlighted by  CIP’s  Pro-Poor Research and Development Impact Assessment model, and through  its partnerships with NGOs, local organizations and national government  agencies, CIP is reaching out to women to more fully integrate their  roles, and access to resources as critical elements of project planning,  implementation and expected impacts.</span><br /><span>Gender is an important consideration when designing strategies for stimulating consumer</span><br /><span>demand.  CIP’s value chain innovations include commercial and technological,  user-friendly information that takes into account gender  differences.Training manuals or modules for supporting CIP products and  programs are also developed with gender-sensitive pedagogies </span><br /><span>Links </span><br /><span>(logo) </span><span>SASHA</span><br /><span>Whilst  women account for as much as 80 percent of Africa’s food production,  their access to land, improved technologies, and  credit is extremely  limited. The Sweetpotato Action for Security and Health in Africa  (SASHA) program focuses on women as producers and guardians of family  nutrition, with special attention to their needs and preferences. </span><br /><span>(</span><span>pic</span><span> with link to Orissa page - see </span><span>Sustainable production in India)</span><span> Read about CIP’s workshops in India targeting women and promoting the  nutritional and culinary benefits of orange-fleshed sweetpotato. </span><br /><span>(</span><span>pic</span><span> link to page </span><span>Working with women in the Andes</span><span>)  CIP- Papa Andina are working across the Andean region promoting women’s  participation in the production and commercialization  of potato and  other highly nutritious Andean roots and tubers</span><span> </span></p>
