<h2><span id="internal-source-marker_0.1949723765719682">Investing in women - key players for ensuring impact</span><span></span></h2>
<p><span>Women play a critical role in producing root and tuber crops. They are also the decision makers in families and communities regarding health and nutrition, and keepers of a wealth of knowledge surrounding crop production and benefits.</span><span></span></p>
<blockquote class="pullquote"><span>“Sustainable agriculture, rural development and food security  cannot be achieved through efforts that ignore or exclude more than half  of the rural population - women” (FAO)</span><span></span></blockquote>
<p><span>Women often work in difficult conditions and receive little recognition for their efforts. With agricultural research and extension services previously broadly directed at men, there has traditionally been a marked difference in the benefits received by men and women. By excluding women, we risk losing the chance to tap into the potential of one of the developing world’s major assets.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Closing the gender gap – the focus of FAO’s 2010-2011 “State of Food and Agriculture”– is one of the key impact issues highlighted by CIP’s </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/cgxchange.org/document/d/16Ukeg3Ek4CzcOGwssUWYNFkC6TRtcEgA819GRRBLtG0/edit?hl=en#bookmark=id.yl7encpwv0jn"><span>Pro-Poor Research and Development</span></a><span> model. Through its partnerships with NGOs, local organizations, and national government agencies, CIP is reaching out to women to support their greater access to resources and critical participation in project planning, implementation, and the expected impacts.</span><br /><span></span></p>
<p><span>Gender is an important consideration when designing strategies for stimulating consumer demand. CIP’s value chain innovations include commercial and technological user-friendly information that takes into account gender differences. Training materials that support CIP products and programs are also developed with gender-sensitive pedagogies.</span><span></span></p>
