<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.16611889232116206">What is genetic engineering?</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Genetic  engineering for plant improvement involves the transfer of specific  genes to crops by means other than pollination. Such genes can be  isolated from any kind of organism, improved, and transferred to  recipient organisms. The most widely used gene transfer method employs a  soil bacterium, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which has the ability to  colonize wounded plant tissue. Molecular biologists have managed to  alter the DNA fragment transferred to the plant in this process,  replacing bacterial genes with genes they have selected to convey  desired traits. These genes, also called transgenes, are integrated into  the plant cell, where they confer their useful properties to the plant.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Why use genetic engineering?</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Genetic  engineering allows for quicker, more targeted development of new  varieties than traditional breeding techniques. In potatoes, for  example, it can take up to 20 years to develop a new variety using  traditional methods, compared with just 3 years with genetic  engineering. </span><br /><span>Features that can be introduced through genetic engineering could lead to:</span><br /><span>• reduced need for chemical inputs (pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers)</span><br /><span>• enhanced nutritive value (more proteins or vitamins)</span><br /><span>• increased resistance to adverse environmental conditions (drought and frost)</span><br /><span>• reduced natural allergens and toxin content</span><br /><span>• increased crop productivity</span><br /><span>• improved crop appearance and flavor</span><br /><span>• broadened crop utility (production of natural compounds for industrial purposes)</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>What is CIP doing?</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Roots  and tubers are susceptible to many pests and diseases. CIP is exploring  the use of genetic engineering to counter these threats to production,  thereby helping developing country farmers to quickly improve their  yields, and hence profits, while safeguarding their health and  protecting the environment.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>CIP  scientists, for example, are studying the use of antifungal proteins in  transgenic potatoes to help combat a fungus-like disease known as late  blight, the number one threat to potato production worldwide. They are  also looking into the possibility of developing varieties with  resistance to important potato diseases caused by bacteria and viruses.  Bacterial diseases are the second most important constraint to potato  production worldwide while virus diseases cause significant problems for  seed certification and for root and tuber productivity. Breeding for  resistance to harmful insects, which affect root and tuber crops mainly  during storage, is another key area of activity at CIP. Scientists have  already engineered potato varieties with resistance to potato tuber  moth, the most damaging potato insect.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>So many benefits, but any concerns?</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Genetic  engineering of organisms, like any new technology, carries some risks.  CIP carefully assesses any modified organisms it develops for possible  negative health or environmental impacts before considering their  release. The Center also works closely with its partners to help them  develop regulatory policies and to recommend procedures for the proper  handling of genetically engineered crops or products, taking into  account the following issues.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Benefit or risk to human health</span><br /><span>There is concern that foreign genes introduced into crops could act as allergens or toxic</span><br /><span>compounds. Rigorous food-testing procedures are applied by regulatory agencies to ensure</span><span> that genetically engineered products are safe for human consumption. The use of genetically</span><span> improved crops with greater resistance to pests and diseases can, on the other hand, lead to</span><span> reduction in the amounts of chemicals used for the production of crops, making these new</span><span> products attractive in terms of environmental and human health.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Benefit or risk to the environment</span><br /><span>There is concern that foreign genes transferred by pollen to sexually compatible plants could</span><span> have a negative impact on the environment, if and when the new plant were to acquire an</span><span> evolutionary advantage over others. This is unlikely, however, since the advantages of</span><span> genetically engineered varieties over other varieties are for crop productivity under</span><span> agricultural production scenarios. Moreover, the use of genetically engineered crops can help</span><span> farmers to produce crops with techniques that will preserve, and hopefully restore, the</span><span> ecology of agricultural environments that have been destroyed by modern, yet harmful,</span><br /><span>agricultural practices.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Benefit or risk to nontarget organisms</span><br /><span>There is concern that genetically engineered crops with resistance to selected pests and</span><br /><span>diseases may also affect nontarget organisms. Laboratory and field trials are regularly</span><br /><span>conducted to assess the impact of modified organisms on natural populations, and the results</span><br /><span>are compared with those of conventional crop protection techniques. In many cases, scientists</span><br /><span>have found that while chemical pesticides attack a broad spectrum of insects, genetic</span><br /><span>engineering involves using gene products that are specific to the targeted pest or pathogen.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Impact on social and cultural change</span><br /><span>Because the application of genetic engineering technology is lead by large, for-profit</span><br /><span>corporations of the developed countries, many people worry that the agricultural production</span><br /><span>problems of the developing countries—and in particular of the lesser developed countries—</span><br /><span>may not benefit adequately from these advances. Moreover, there is concern that genetic</span><br /><span>engineering may lead to increased farmer dependence on the corporations that sell these</span><br /><span>products, and that the availability of new high-performing varieties may reduce the diversity</span><br /><span>of the varieties grown by farmers. With this in mind, CIP has placed special emphasis on</span><br /><span>mobilizing efforts from development and cooperation agencies to promote genetic</span><br /><span>engineering technologies that will be appropriate for and available to resource-poor farmers.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>What is the risk of not doing?</span><br /><span>Because of the controversy surrounding genetically transformed crops, the concerns</span><br /><span>surrounding them and the strong opposition to their use, there has been a trend to place  a</span><br /><span>de facto moratorium on the development of genetic engineering technology in many</span><br /><span>countries. The real risk to developing country agriculture, however, is that these technologies</span><br /><span>and the benefits they can bring may not be applied to—or even be accessible by—countries</span><br /><span>in urgent need of the solutions they can offer to pressing food security problems.</span></p>
