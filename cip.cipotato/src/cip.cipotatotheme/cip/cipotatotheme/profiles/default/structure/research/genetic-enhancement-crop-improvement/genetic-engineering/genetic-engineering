<h2><span id="internal-source-marker_0.635411890456453">What is genetic engineering?</span><span> </span></h2>
<p><span>Genetic engineering for plant improvement involves the transfer of specific genes to crops by means other than pollination. Such genes can be isolated from any kind of organism, improved, and transferred to recipient organisms. The most widely used gene transfer method employs a soil bacterium, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which has the ability to colonize wounded plant tissue. Molecular biologists have managed to alter the DNA fragment transferred to the plant in this process, replacing bacterial genes with genes they have selected to convey desired traits. These genes, also called transgenes, are integrated into the plant cell, where they confer their useful properties to the plant.</span><span></span></p>
<h2><span>Why use genetic engineering?</span><span></span></h2>
<p><span>Genetic engineering allows for quicker, more targeted development of new varieties than traditional breeding techniques. In potatoes, for example, it can take up to 20 years to develop a new variety using traditional methods, compared with just 3 years with genetic engineering. </span></p>
<p><span>Features that can be introduced through genetic engineering could lead to:</span><span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Reduced need for chemical inputs (pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers)</span></li>
<li><span>Enhanced nutritive value (more proteins or vitamins)</span></li>
<li><span>Increased resistance to adverse environmental conditions (drought and frost)</span></li>
<li><span>Reduced natural allergens and toxin content</span></li>
<li><span>Increased crop productivity</span></li>
<li><span>Improved crop appearance and flavor</span></li>
<li><span>Broadened crop utility (production of natural compounds for industrial purposes)<br /><br /></span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span>What is CIP doing?</span><span></span></h2>
<p><span>Roots and tubers are susceptible to many pests and diseases. CIP is exploring the use of genetic engineering to counter these threats to production, thereby helping developing country farmers to quickly improve their yields, and hence profits, while safeguarding their health and protecting the environment.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>CIP scientists, for example, are studying the use of antifungal proteins in transgenic potatoes to help combat a fungus-like disease known as late blight, the number one threat to potato production worldwide. They are also looking into the possibility of developing varieties with resistance to important potato diseases caused by bacteria and viruses. Bacterial diseases are the second most important constraint to potato production worldwide while virus diseases cause significant problems for seed certification and for root and tuber productivity. Breeding for resistance to harmful insects, which affect root and tuber crops mainly during storage, is another key area of activity at CIP. Scientists have already engineered potato varieties with resistance to potato tuber moth, the most damaging potato insect.</span><span></span></p>
<h2><span>So many benefits, but any concerns?</span><span></span></h2>
<p><span>Genetic engineering of organisms, like any new technology, carries some risks. CIP carefully assesses any modified organisms it develops for possible negative health or environmental impacts before considering their release. The Center also works closely with its partners to help them develop regulatory policies and to recommend procedures for the proper handling of genetically engineered crops or products, taking into account the following issues.</span><span></span></p>
<h2><span>Benefit or risk to human health</span></h2>
<p><span></span><span>There is concern that foreign genes introduced into crops could act as allergens or toxic</span><br /><span>compounds. Rigorous food-testing procedures are applied by regulatory agencies to ensure</span> <span>that genetically engineered products are safe for human consumption. The use of genetically</span> <span>improved crops with greater resistance to pests and diseases can, on the other hand, lead to</span> <span>reduction in the amounts of chemicals used for the production of crops, making these new</span> <span>products attractive in terms of environmental and human health.</span><span></span></p>
<h2><span>Benefit or risk to the environment</span></h2>
<p><span></span><span>There is concern that foreign genes transferred by pollen to sexually compatible plants could</span> <span>have a negative impact on the environment, if and when the new plant were to acquire an</span> <span>evolutionary advantage over others. This is unlikely, however, since the advantages of</span> <span>genetically engineered varieties over other varieties are for crop productivity under</span> <span>agricultural production scenarios. Moreover, the use of genetically engineered crops can help</span> <span>farmers to produce crops with techniques that will preserve, and hopefully restore, the</span> <span>ecology of agricultural environments that have been destroyed by modern, yet harmful,</span><br /><span>agricultural practices.</span><span></span></p>
<h2><span>Benefit or risk to nontarget organisms</span><span></span></h2>
<p><span>There is concern that genetically engineered crops with resistance to selected pests and</span><br /><span>diseases may also affect nontarget organisms. Laboratory and field trials are regularly</span><br /><span>conducted to assess the impact of modified organisms on natural populations, and the results</span> <span>are compared with those of conventional crop protection techniques. In many cases, scientists</span> <span>have found that while chemical pesticides attack a broad spectrum of insects, genetic</span> <span>engineering involves using gene products that are specific to the targeted pest or pathogen.</span><span></span></p>
<h2><span>Impact on social and cultural change</span><span></span></h2>
<p><span>Because the application of genetic engineering technology is lead by large, for-profit</span><br /><span>corporations of the developed countries, many people worry that the agricultural production</span><br /><span>problems of the developing countries—and in particular of the lesser developed countries—</span><br /><span>may not benefit adequately from these advances. Moreover, there is concern that genetic</span><br /><span>engineering may lead to increased farmer dependence on the corporations that sell these</span><br /><span>products, and that the availability of new high-performing varieties may reduce the diversity</span><br /><span>of the varieties grown by farmers. With this in mind, CIP has placed special emphasis on</span><br /><span>mobilizing efforts from development and cooperation agencies to promote genetic</span><br /><span>engineering technologies that will be appropriate for and available to resource-poor farmers.</span><span></span></p>
<h2><span>What is the risk of not doing?</span></h2>
<p><span></span><span>Because of the controversy surrounding genetically transformed crops, the concerns</span><br /><span>surrounding them and the strong opposition to their use, there has been a trend to place a</span><br /><span>de facto moratorium on the development of genetic engineering technology in many</span><br /><span>countries. The real risk to developing country agriculture, however, is that these technologies</span> <span>and the benefits they can bring may not be applied to—or even be accessible by—countries</span> <span>in urgent need of the solutions they can offer to pressing food security problems.</span></p>
