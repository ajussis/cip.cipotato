<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.635411890456453">In the face of demographic shifts and climate change, increasing food supplies for resource-poor populations is an urgent priority. Farmers, especially those in developing countries, need to produce reliable, profitable, and healthful crops and, at the same time, reduce their dependence on costly, harmful pesticides.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Using genetics in plant breeding is the safest and most economical way to develop protection from pests, diseases, and environmental stresses. However, it can take up to 20 years to develop a new variety using traditional methods. Genetic engineering, which involves the transfer of specific genes by means other than pollination, allows quicker, more targeted development of new varieties. CIP uses both traditional and nontraditional methods.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The discovery of new genes and the development of tools to guide their use is a critical step toward continuing improvements in crop protection, productivity, and value. CIPâ€™s breeding program is dedicated to developing durable resistance to major diseases, enhancing market and nutritional value, and improving adaptation to marginal environments.</span></p>
