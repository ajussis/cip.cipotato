<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.16611889232116206">In  the face of demographic shifts and climate change, increasing food  supplies for resource-poor populations is an urgent priority. Farmers,  especially those in developing countries, need to produce reliable,  profitable, and healthful crops and, at the same time, reduce their  dependence on costly, harmful pesticides.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Using  genetics in plant breeding is the safest and most economical way to  develop protection from pests, diseases, and environmental stresses.  However, it can take up to 20 years to develop a new variety using  traditional methods. Genetic engineering, which involves the transfer of  specific genes by means other than pollination, allows quicker, more  targeted development of new varieties. CIP uses both traditional and  nontraditional methods.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>The  discovery of new genes and the development of tools to guide their use  is a critical step toward continuing improvements in crop protection,  productivity, and value. CIPâ€™s breeding program is dedicated to  developing durable resistance to major diseases, enhancing market and  nutritional value, and improving adaptation to marginal environments.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Links</span><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/cgxchange.org/document/d/16Ukeg3Ek4CzcOGwssUWYNFkC6TRtcEgA819GRRBLtG0/edit?hl=en#bookmark=id.u2r8uu-dly7tp"><span>Quality and Nutrition Lab</span></a><span></span><br /><a href="http://www.cipotato.org/publications/pdf/002560.pdf"><span>Genetic engineering at CIP</span></a></p>
