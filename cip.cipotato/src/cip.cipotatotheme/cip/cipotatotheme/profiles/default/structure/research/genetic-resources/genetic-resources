<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.635411890456453">CIP’s genebank is its single greatest institutional asset. As climate change and urbanization place additional pressure on the land, CIP is redoubling its commitment to the safety and utilization of the crop collections in its care. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Research priorities include support for in-situ community conservation programs and initiatives that encourage the re-introduction of traditional varieties in areas now dominated by commercial cultivars, along with ex-situ collection and preservation in the genebank. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Steps are being taken to fully characterize and evaluate all CIP genebank holdings, thereby expanding the utility of CIP-held collections and promoting greater diversity in farmers’ fields.</span></p>
