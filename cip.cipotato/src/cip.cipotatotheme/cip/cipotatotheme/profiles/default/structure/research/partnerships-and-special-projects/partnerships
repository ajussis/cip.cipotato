<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.635411890456453">CIP has a rich and successful history of creating, coordinating, and working in partnerships. Partners and stakeholders span a range of groups and individuals, including formal partnership programs, advanced National Agricultural Research (NAR) institutions, and small-holder associations.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>CIP’s close collaboration in these rich and varied partnerships helps ensure that we are effectively meeting the needs of our stakeholders, expanding the reach of our research, and delivering concrete benefits for end users.</span><span></span><span></span></p>
<p><span>As traditional research and development networks expand to include non-governmental organizations, producers groups, the private sector, policy-decision makers, and local communities, partnerships have become a central feature of international agricultural research-for-development organizations.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>CIP's partnerships and partnership strategies have evolved. As our partner countries  develop greater institutional capacity, the form of our partnership changes; for example, in the emerging BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) economies, our partners are now advanced research institutions.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Partnership continues to be a research priority for CIP social scientists, who are experimenting with and publishing on new forms of partnerships for pro-poor innovation in market chains.</span></p>
