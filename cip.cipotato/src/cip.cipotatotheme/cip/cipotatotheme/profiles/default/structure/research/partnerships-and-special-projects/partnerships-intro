<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.1949723765719682">CIP has a rich and successful history of creating, coordinating and working in partnerships. Partners and stakeholders span a whole range of groups and individuals, including advanced National Agricultural Research Institutes (NARI), universities, civil and small-holder organizations and associations, and the private sector. They also vary widely in structure, from informal knowledge networking to formal partnership programs.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>CIP’s close collaborative linkages within these rich and varied partnerships helps ensure that we are effectively meeting the needs of our stakeholders, expanding the reach of our research, and delivering concrete benefits for end users.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>As traditional research and development networks have expanded to include non-governmental organizations, producers groups, the private sector, policy-decision makers and local communities, working in partnership has become a central feature of international agricultural research-for development organizations.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>As CIP has evolved, so have our partnerships and partnership strategies. As our partner countries have developed greater institutional and scientific capacity, the goals of our partnerships have shifted, particularly with emerging BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) economies, where our partnerships now involve advanced scientific exchanges.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Partnership continues to be a research priority for CIP’s social scientists who are analyzing the lessons from existing and past research partnerships to contribute to new and better partnership strategies for pro-poor innovation in rootcrop-based food systems. </span></p>
