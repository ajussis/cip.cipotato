<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.16611889232116206">CIP  has a rich and successful history of creating, coordinating and working  in partnerships.  Partners and stakeholders span a whole range of  groups and individuals, including formal partnership programs, advanced  National Agricultural Research (NAR) institutions, and small-holder  associations.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>CIP’s  close collaboration within these rich and varied partnerships helps  ensure that we are effectively meeting the needs of our stakeholders,  expanding the reach of our research, and delivering concrete benefits  for end users.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>As  traditional research and development networks have expanded to include  non-governmental organizations, producers groups, the private sector,  policy-decision makers and local communities, working in partnership has  become a central feature of international agricultural research-for  development organizations.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>And  as CIP has evolved, so have our partnerships and partnership  strategies. As our partner countries have developed greater  institutional capacity, the forms of our partnerships have shifted,  particularly with emerging BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China)  economies, where our partnerships are now those of advanced research  partners</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Partnership  continues to be a research priority for CIP’s social scientists who are  experimenting with and publishing on new forms of partnerships for  pro-poor innovation in market chains. </span></p>
