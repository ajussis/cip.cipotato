At elevations  between 1,500 and 4,000 meters, this agro-ecosystem includes potato  areas in Asia, Africa, and South America. </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Poor farmers in the highlands grow potatoes both for food and to generate income.</span><br /><span>Production  constraints include small farm size, crop vulnerability to disease and  pests, and increasingly, extreme weather events linked to climate  change.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>CIP  is developing more nutritious, pest- and disease-resistant varieties,  introducing agricultural practices that conserve natural resources, and  implementing participatory market approaches to increase incomes and  promote sustainable development.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Given  the socio-economic similarities among the targeted areas, CIP is  expanding its work in Peru over an initial period. The technologies and  practices that result will be adapted and implemented in Asia, Africa,  and other South American countries. </span><br /><span></span><br /><a href="http://www.papandina.org/"><span>Papa Andina</span></a><span>,  a regional initiative coordinated by CIP, fosters pro-poor innovation  in market chains to improve food security and increase market access for  small-scale farmers.</span><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/cgxchange.org/document/d/16Ukeg3Ek4CzcOGwssUWYNFkC6TRtcEgA819GRRBLtG0/edit?hl=en#bookmark=id.q472bu-xhd337"><span>Cooperation-88 in China</span></a><span></span><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/cgxchange.org/document/d/16Ukeg3Ek4CzcOGwssUWYNFkC6TRtcEgA819GRRBLtG0/edit?hl=en#bookmark=id.u2r8uu-dly7tp"><span>Quality &amp; Nutrition Lab</span></a></p>
