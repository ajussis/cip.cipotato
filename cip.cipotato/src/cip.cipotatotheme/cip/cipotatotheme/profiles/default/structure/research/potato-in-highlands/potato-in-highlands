<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.635411890456453">The Andean highlands, where potato was first domesticated, is the primary center for the conservation of potato biodiversity. At elevations between 1,500 and 4,000 meters, this agro-ecosystem includes potato areas in Asia, Africa, and South America. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span><img alt="Potato in highlands" class="image-right" height="171" src="35aoptimizada.jpg" width="258" />Poor farmers in the highlands grow potatoes both for food and to generate income.</span><br /><span>Production constraints include small farm size, crop vulnerability to disease and pests, and increasingly, extreme weather events linked to climate change.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>CIP is developing more nutritious, pest- and disease-resistant varieties, introducing agricultural practices that conserve natural resources, and implementing participatory market approaches to increase incomes and promote sustainable development.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Given the socio-economic similarities among the targeted areas, CIP is expanding its work in Peru over an initial period. The technologies and practices that result will be adapted and implemented in Asia, Africa, and other South American countries. </span><a href="http://www.papandina.org/"><span></span></a></p>
