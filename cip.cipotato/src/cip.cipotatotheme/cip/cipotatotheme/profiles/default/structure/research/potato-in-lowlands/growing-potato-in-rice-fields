<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.30517161288298666">Farmers in China have developed a tillage system that allows them to produce a winter potato crop on paddy rice soil. </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Potato production in rice fields is very complicated and affected by many factors, including weather, soil, planting methods, fertilization, mulch, varieties, and seed. The farmer-developed system is costly, which discourages poor farmers from planting a winter potato crop.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>The result of research and experimentation in three South China provinces will be a new, simple, low-cost planting method combined with the optimized use of rice straws and fertilizers, minimum tillage, suitable varieties, high-quality seed potatoes, and appropriate small-sized machinery. </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>CIP aims to build flexibility into the system so it can be applied on a wider scale in Southeast Asia.</span></p>
