<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.16611889232116206">Promoting early maturing varieties to diversify cereal-based systems</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Throughout  Asia’s subtropical lowlands, potatoes serve as an important complement  to cereal-based diets and provide farmers with much-needed seasonal  income. Expanding and intensifying Asia’s winter potato crop provides an  important opportunity to increase food supplies and improve nutrition  in areas where natural resources are scarce and food security is an  on-going concern.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Potato  production normally takes place in the short days of the winter season  between harvesting and planting rice. Because Asia’s winter potatoes are  grown with residual moisture following the monsoon, the crop often  needs supplementary irrigation, a resource unavailable at many  locations. Compounding the problem is unpredictable or uneven rainfall  that often leads to drought or, conversely, water logging. The  development of an early, heat-tolerant potato—one that can utilize  residual irrigation water—would greatly benefit farmers.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Even  when crops are bountiful, hot rainy periods can intensify field and  storage losses due to diseases and pests. Because cold storage is not an  option for most farmers, long dormancy periods and good storage  characteristics are considered important agronomic traits.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>CIP  is working to establish an integrated breeding system to deliver  varieties of early maturing, heat-tolerant potatoes that meet the  requirements of Asian farmers, consumers, and markets. Tandem efforts  include disseminating technologies and best practices to sustain a  diversified cropping system; facilitating production and distribution of  high-quality, improved seed; and building local and national capacity  to reach large numbers of households, particularly those headed by women  and landless people.</span></p>
