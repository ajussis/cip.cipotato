<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.16611889232116206">Conserving water, enhancing incomes</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>The  temperate regions of Asia include portions of China, Korea, and Central  Asia. Potato is an important cash and staple crop that contributes  vital nutrients to the diets of the poor. In Central Asia, where potato  production is second only to wheat, consumption rates rank among the  highest in the world. In recent years, the crop has emerged as a popular  food in the urban markets of China and as an essential food security  crop in DPR Korea.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Production  systems vary across the temperate zone from diversified, single  cropping to intensive double cropping. Potato pests and diseases affect  yield and profitability. Water shortages are linked to both greater  competition and climate change. In Central Asia, </span><br /><span>limited  investment in research and development have led to the loss of older  local potato varieties and Russian clones. Because the supply of quality  seed tubers is limited, farmers often rely on expensive imported seed,  much of which is poorly adapted to local conditions. These problems  often deny poor consumers access to a crop that could greatly reduce  malnutrition. The absence of nutrient-rich foods, a common occurrence in  Central Asia, is responsible for high mortality rates among young  mothers and children under the age of five.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>CIP  is helping national partners assemble the best available genetic  materials, produce quality seed, develop effective management practices,  and influence policies that promote more durable management of natural  resources.</span></p>
