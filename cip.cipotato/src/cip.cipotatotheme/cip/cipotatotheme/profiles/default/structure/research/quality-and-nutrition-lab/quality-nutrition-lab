<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.16611889232116206">Micronutrients  are vitamins and minerals required in small amounts to ensure normal  metabolism, growth, and physical well‐being. </span><br /><span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span>The  Quality and Nutrition Laboratory supports research-for-development  projects that aim to reduce malnutrition or promote health by improving  the nutritional quality of potato and sweetpotato. </span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span>The  Quality and Nutrition Laboratory evaluates the micronutrient content of  potato and sweetpotato cultivars. Iron, zinc, and provitamin A  carotenoids are evaluated for projects that aim to reduce malnutrition  by improving the nutritional quality of potato and sweetpotato.  Antioxidant concentrations are evaluated projects that seek to promote  health through the improvement of the antioxidant concentration of these  crops. </span></p>
<p><span></span><br /><span>Chemical analysis</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Fresh  or dried samples of unpeeled raw potato tubers and sweetpotato roots  are evaluated for carotenoid, polyphenol, ascorbic acid, and mineral  content. A selected group of varieties or clones is also analyzed in  cooked form. </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Chemical  analyses are carried out using spectrophotometry, high-performance  liquid chromatography (HPLC), and inductively coupled plasma optical  emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) mass spectrometry.  Since 2005, more  than 500 potato varieties and more than 1,000 sweetpotato genotypes have  been analyzed.</span><br /><span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span>Near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) analysis</span></p>
<p><span></span><br /><span>Although  chemical methods are very accurate, the high costs of these methods and  the time required for analysis limits their use to small numbers of  samples relative to those required in extensive screening and breeding  programs. </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>NIRS  is a rapid and relatively inexpensive technique that facilitates  analysis of several traits simultaneously. It does not need chemical  reagents and avoids contamination with chemical waste. </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>NIRS  calibrations have been developed to estimate the carotenoid and  phenolic content of freeze-dried and milled potato and sweetpotato  samples. These calibrations are precise and useful for selecting  varieties with high, medium, or low concentrations of micronutrients and  selecting varieties for starch, protein, and individual sugars.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>To  date more than 100,000 sweetpotato samples and more than 10,000 potato  samples from different breeding programs have been analyzed by NIRS,  facilitating the breeding progress for nutritional improvement of potato  and sweetpotato.</span></p>
