<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.16611889232116206">A holistic approach to complex, dynamic problems.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Understanding  the economics of pest management in the Andes. Demonstrating a link  between providing orange-fleshed sweetpotato to ante natal clinics and  reducing Vitamin A deficiency in Africa. Negotiating marketing  agreements with supermarkets in Indonesia. These are just some of the  interdisciplinary skills involved in engaging the social, economic and  cultural dimensions that help research to deliver concrete results.</span><br /><span> </span><br /><span>The  root- and tuber-based systems that CIP targets are located in areas of  extreme poverty, where communities are especially vulnerable to external  forces and natural stresses such as climate change. We need a  comprehensive understanding of those vulnerabilities if we are to  develop resilient agro-ecosystems that can buffer shock and help people  adapt to change.</span><br /><span> </span><br /><span>To  that end we bring together a diverse set of people:  agro-economists  working in a range of specialties from economic analysis to marketing  and impact assessment, sociologists, anthropologists, statisticians,  post harvest specialists  and health professionals including  nutritionists and medical doctors. </span><br /><span> </span><br /><span>These  scientists work together, contributing to different programs at  different levels of scale. Talking to each other, learning from each  other within and across disciplines and within the communities where  projects are taking place, they develop the interdisciplinary skills,  strategies, and tactics which add value to CIP's commodity research.</span></p>
