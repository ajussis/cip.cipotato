<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.635411890456453">Sweetpotato production is expanding faster than any other major crop in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), covering more than 3 million hectares and producing in excess of 13 million tons of roots annually. </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>With a reputation as a mainstay emergency crop, it is grown mainly in small, rainfed plots by women. Working to overcome sweetpotato’s image as a poor person’s food, research is creating income-generating opportunities for these small scale farmers by building consumer awareness, diversifying use and increasing market opportunities in the region’s expanding urban markets.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Farmers in SSA produce an average of 4-6 tons of sweetpotato roots per hectare. In contrast, commercial growers in South Africa with access to irrigation, fertilizers, and credit routinely produce ten times that amount. The potential is there. CIP is tackling this “yield gap” between subsistence and commercial producers; providing clean planting material and locally adapted improved varieties, tackling damage caused by sweetpotato weevils and emerging pests, and training farmers in new improved agronomic practices.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>An estimated 43 million African children under the age of five are threatened by vitamin A deficiency, a condition causing blindness, disease and premature death. CIP scientists and extension workers promote the consumption of the orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) varieties known to be high in beta carotene (a precursor to vitamin A) in a food based approach to combating vitamin A deficiency. The challenge is to breed OFSP varieties that meet consumer preferences and can compete with the traditional white- and yellow-fleshed varieties.</span></p>
