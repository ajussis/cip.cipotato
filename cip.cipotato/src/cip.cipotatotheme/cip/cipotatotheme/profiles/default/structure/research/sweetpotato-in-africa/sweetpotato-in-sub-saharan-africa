<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.16611889232116206">Exploiting the full potential of a food security classic</span><span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Sweetpotato  production is expanding faster than any other major crop in Sub-Saharan  Africa (SSA), covering more than 3 million hectares and producing in  excess of 13 million tons of roots annually. </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>With  a reputation as a mainstay emergency crop, it is grown mainly in small,  rainfed plots by women. Working to overcome sweetpotato’s image as a  poor person’s food, research is creating income-generating opportunities  for these small scale farmers by building consumer awareness,  diversifying use and increasing market opportunities in the region’s  expanding urban markets.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Farmers  in SSA produce an average of 4-6 tons of sweetpotato roots per hectare.  In contrast, commercial growers in South Africa with access to  irrigation, fertilizers, and credit routinely produce ten times that  amount. The potential is there. CIP is tackling this “yield gap” between  subsistence and commercial producers; providing clean planting material  and locally adapted improved varieties, tackling damage caused by  sweetpotato weevils and emerging pests, and training farmers in new  improved agronomic practices.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>An  estimated 43 million African children under the age of five are  threatened by vitamin A deficiency, a condition causing blindness,  disease and premature death. CIP scientists and extension workers  promote the consumption of the orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP)  varieties known to be high in beta carotene (a precursor to vitamin A)   in a food based approach to combating vitamin A deficiency. The  challenge is to breed OFSP varieties that meet consumer preferences and  can compete with the traditional white- and yellow-fleshed varieties. </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Links</span><span></span><br /><span>(SPHI logo) Sweetpotato for Profit and Health (</span><span>SPHI</span><span>) </span><span>Enhancing the</span><span> </span><span>lives of ten million African families in ten years</span><br /><span>(SASHA logo) </span><span>Exploiting the untapped potential of sweetpotato to improve food security and livelihoods in Sub Saharan Africa</span><br /><span>Sweetpotato for Africa catalogue</span><span> (PDF) A reference for scientists, development practitioners, and  donors, providing information on the region’s current important and  popular varieties</span><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/cgxchange.org/document/d/16Ukeg3Ek4CzcOGwssUWYNFkC6TRtcEgA819GRRBLtG0/edit?hl=en#bookmark=id.u2r8uu-dly7tp"><span>Quality &amp; Nutrition Lab </span></a></p>
