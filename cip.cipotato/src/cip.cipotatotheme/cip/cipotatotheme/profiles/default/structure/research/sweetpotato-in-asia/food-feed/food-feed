<p><span>Sweetpotato is a valuable feed resource for smallholder crop-livestock systems in Asia’s tropical and subtropical lowlands where pig production is an important livelihood option. The major advantage is that the crop can also provide food for human consumption.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>With the demand for forage producing sweetpotato varieties increasing, CIP scientists use the Center’s extensive sweetpotato germplasm to breed improved dual-purpose SP (roots and vines) varieties. CIP aims to exploit the full feed potential of improved sweetpotato varieties, ensuring that farmers have better livestock nutrition and productivity, and higher household income.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Traditionally sweetpotato roots are harvested at the end of the cropping season leaving the vines in the field. Scientists work out how the varieties can be more fully exploited, utilizing the sweetpotato’s good regrowth capacity by harvesting the vines throughout the growing season before finally harvesting the root.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Feed costs are the largest component of the total production cost in most crop-livestock production systems. The use of sweetpotato silage, combined with locally available raw materials, requires very little capital investment or equipment, reducing production costs and increasing gross margins for farmers. The system provides manure for maintaining and improving soil fertility. Importantly it also frees up time for women farmers, and the boost to women’s production capacity brings numerous benefits to communities. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>With rapid economic growth, adapting small-scale farming systems to change is an essential tool in the fight against poverty. Simple efficient technologies like these sweetpotato-pig feed systems make a big difference to poor farmers, opening up potential for larger scale breeding enterprises and environmentally sustainable commercial production, but at the same time protecting the vital natural resources from which they draw their livelihood</span>.<span></span><span></span></p>
