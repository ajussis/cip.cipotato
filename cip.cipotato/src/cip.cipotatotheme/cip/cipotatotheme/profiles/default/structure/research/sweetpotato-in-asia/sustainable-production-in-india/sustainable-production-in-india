However, despite having the highest  recorded area of sweetpotato production in the country, the state, which  is one of India’s poorest and suffers high rates of malnutrition, still  has low productivity rates compared to the national average. </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>CIP’s  project is improving sustainable sweetpotato production from planting  to harvesting to post harvest utilization, increasing opportunities for  farmers, generating income, and improving nutrition. </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Lack  of efficient seed systems for multiplication, improper management of  nurseries, lack of techniques for easy and rapid multiplication, and  lack of availability of improved varieties are just some of the  challenges that CIP and its partners are addressing. </span><br /><span> </span><br /><span>A  key research area is continued breeding for enhanced yields.  Encouraging good agricultural practices such as intercropping and mixed  cropping of sweetpotato with other crops also results in increasing  yields. </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Research   scientists and extension agencies work together to improve  productivity through crop improvement and better post-harvest  ultilization. Outreach activities offer access to high quality planting  material, whilst workshops and training focus on crop management  techniques, including integrated pest management and the importance of  different varieties. </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>(pic) </span><span>Farmers particpatory planting in western Orissa.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>The  introduction of nutrient-rich orange-fleshed sweetpotato varieties  forms part of CIP’s food-based strategy for tackling vitamin A  deficiency. Alongside this initiative active efforts are underway in  Orissa to incorporate the varieties into indigenous sweetpotato recipes </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>A winning combination(sidebar)</span><br /><span>Women plus science plus sweetpotato </span><br /><span>Women are the primary health and nutrition decision makers for their families and communities.</span><span></span><br /><span>CIP  works with the Indian Department of Agricultural Research and  Education’s  Directorate of Research on Women in Agriculture providing  hands on workshops where food scientists,local women and consumer groups  develop and taste test new nutritious recipes</span></p>
