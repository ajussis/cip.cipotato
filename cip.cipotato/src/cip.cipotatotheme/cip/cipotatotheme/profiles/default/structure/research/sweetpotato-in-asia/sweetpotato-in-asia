<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.16611889232116206">Sustainable strategies for reducing poverty</span><span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span>In  Asia’s rapidly developing economy, rural poverty persists, with more  than 200 million rural poor living on less than US$1 a day. Vibrant  growth and evolving markets mean that knowledge about how to adapt small  scale farming systems to change is a crucial tool for increasing their  incomes. </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Asia  accounts for 86 percent of world sweetpotato production, with China  alone contributing 80 percent. Sweetpotato is also a major crop in  India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, and other  Pacific Islands. In South Asia, sweetpotato is an important staple for  food security, but much of the sweetpotato grown in the region is  destined for animal feed or processing. </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>CIP  priorities are on providing adapted varieties that are nutritious, can  be used for food and feed, are tolerant to drought and salinity, and are  pest and disease resistant. Projects train farmers in sweetpotato crop  management, with efforts directed at adding value, developing products,   improving collaboration, and strengthening links throughout the market  chain.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>In  other projects the development of cheap, nutritious sweetpotato based  feed formulas reduces production costs, resulting in greater gross  margins for the region’s farmers who largely depend on mixed  crop-livestock agricultulture. </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Approximately  45 percent of the world’s vitamin A-deficient (VAD) children and  pregnant women live in South and Southeast Asia. The condition causes  blindness, disease and premature death.  and although the use of  orange-fleshed sweetpotato (OFSP) in Asia to combat VAD is not yet as  advanced as it is in Africa, CIP is introducing varieties that are rich  in Vitamin  A along with successful outreach programs promoting their  consumption.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Links</span><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/cgxchange.org/document/d/16Ukeg3Ek4CzcOGwssUWYNFkC6TRtcEgA819GRRBLtG0/edit?hl=en#bookmark=id.co6mfe-wdi9wh"><span>Food &amp; feed</span></a><span></span><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/cgxchange.org/document/d/16Ukeg3Ek4CzcOGwssUWYNFkC6TRtcEgA819GRRBLtG0/edit?hl=en#bookmark=id.tipcza-26bo1r"><span>Sustainable production in India </span></a><span></span><br /><span>Improving seed systems and sweetpotato production in the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea </span><span>(link to News from CIP Issue no 3 Oct 2009)</span><span></span><br /><span>More food security and extra income for subsistence farmers in Timor-Leste (link to </span><span>News from CIP Issue no 1 March 2010) </span><span></span><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/cgxchange.org/document/d/16Ukeg3Ek4CzcOGwssUWYNFkC6TRtcEgA819GRRBLtG0/edit?hl=en#bookmark=id.u2r8uu-dly7tp"><span>Quality &amp; Nutrition Lab</span></a></p>
