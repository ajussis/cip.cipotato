<h2><span class="title1">CIP Learning and Knowledge Sharing Seminars </span></h2>
<p class="text"><img align="left" height="167" hspace="6" src="http://www.cipotato.org/csd/images2008/f_seminar1.jpg" width="250" />CIP’s Capacity Strengthening  Department (CSD) sponsors seminars on an ongoing but irregular basis.  Please check our <a href="http://www.cipotato.org/csd/schedule.asp"><b>seminars  and activities schedule</b></a> for details which are periodically updated. These seminars are a  platform for debating  new ideas; testing theories and methodologies;  discussing project ideas or  activities; and reporting on new research  in an informal setting allowing  feedback from colleagues on  pre-publication or published results.</p>
<p class="text">The seminars are also an  opportunity for wider  scientific community learning and knowledge sharing on  topical,  cutting-edge concerns as well core research topics relevant to CIP’s   mission. They may be of wider interest  to the CGIAR system and its  partners.  Our seminars complement other educational and training  activities at CIP  aimed at strengthening agricultural research  capacities of developing country  scientists, contributing to the  reduction of poverty and achieving global food  security, and supporting  new knowledge as an international public good.</p>
<p class="text">Although most seminars are  held at CIP headquarters Lima, the CSD also  <a href="http://www.cipotato.org/csd/seminars_arc.asp"><b>posts information</b></a> (check our <a href="http://www.cipotato.org/csd/seminars_arc.asp"><b>archives</b></a>)  on similar CIP-sponsored educational events in regional or  project  offices in Asia, Africa and other parts of Latin   America when details  are provided.  Subject to additional resources the CSD can also help  facilitate  real-time, international seminars on special themes among  colleagues in  different countries, as well other distance learning  activities.</p>
<p class="text">CIP also aims to make these seminar discussions available as <a href="http://www.cipotato.org/csd/material.asp"><b>open learning materials and resources</b></a> for others not able to attend in person, or to access and review  later.  So in preparing for the seminar we ask each presenter to  provide:</p>
<ol>
<li class="text">A presentation title and abstract; </li>
<li class="text">A copy of their power point presentation; </li>
<li class="text">Any more detailed working papers or other supporting background documents they may also wish to share; and </li>
<li class="text">A short bio. </li>
</ol>
<p class="text">We will post all materials on our <a href="http://www.cipotato.org/csd/seminars_arc.asp"><b>web site</b></a>,  subject to author permission and any copy-write provisions or  restrictions.  We also aim to audio record most seminars and make most  of them accessible later through web pod-casting.</p>
<p class="text">The CSD hosts three main  types of seminars.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="text"><b>Visiting Scholars and Officials </b></p>
<p class="text">The first type is given by  visiting national or  international scholars, post-graduate fellows, CGIAR  colleagues, donors  and other agency or government officials who are already on  mission or  doing research at CIP. The  CSD coordinates most of these activities  with the CIP Visitors Office and CIP  scientists or Departments who host  them.</p>
<p class="text"><b>CIP Scientists </b></p>
<p class="text">The second type is by CIP  Scientists who are already  based in Lima  or are from regional or project offices but are at  Headquarters on other  business. These seminars are a way for  more  interdisciplinary dialogue among CIP staff  scientists on a range of  possible research  topics and project ideas. They are a way  to more  systematically report on and debate ongoing research and expected   results, or test and share knowledge, to refine scientists’ work prior  to  publication.</p>
<p class="text"><b>Students, Interns and Trainees </b></p>
<p class="text"><img align="left" height="167" hspace="6" src="http://www.cipotato.org/csd/images2008/f_seminar2.jpg" width="250" />The  third type is given by  students doing sponsored research at CIP.    Each student is normally required to give at least two seminars at   CIP.  One is held near the beginning of term  within their home Division  or Department as they are formulating their research  project proposal.  That first seminar is an opportunity for students to define  and  operationalize their research objectives among peers and in cooperation   with their supervisor.  The student will later  give a second seminar  near the end of their tenure at CIP to report on the  results of their  research project or thesis.   The second presentation is a more public  and formal opportunity (pod-cast  recorded) for students to report on  and debate their findings among their peers  and all interested CIP  staff scientists before their final university thesis  defense.   Students are required to give  this final seminar as part of a “<a href="http://intranet.cip.cgiar.org/research/training/learning_knowledge_sharing_contract.asp" target="_blank"><b>Learning and  Knowledge Sharing Contract</b></a>”  with their supervisors  and the Capacity Strengthening Department.  This requirement is reinforced by <b><a href="http://intranet.cip.cgiar.org/research/training/cip_policies.asp" target="_blank">CIP Policies</a></b> and <b><a href="http://intranet.cip.cgiar.org/research/training/guidelines_students_interns_trainees.asp" target="_blank">Guidelines for Students, Interns and Trainees</a></b>.  Interns or trainees at CIP for only a short  term are not required to  give seminars as a matter of policy, but may still do  with  encouragement or permission from their hosting supervisors.</p>
