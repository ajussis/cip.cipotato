<p>CIP’s Capacity Strengthening  Department (CSD) sponsors seminars on an ongoing but irregular basis.  Please check our <b>seminars  and activities schedule below</b> for details which are periodically updated. These seminars are a   platform for debating  new ideas; testing theories and methodologies;   discussing project ideas or  activities; and reporting on new research   in an informal setting allowing  feedback from colleagues on   pre-publication or published results.</p>
