<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.007881521480157971">Sweetpotatoes are good sources of carbohydrates, fiber and many micronutrients.  They produce more edible energy per hectare per day than wheat, rice or cassava. The leaves and shoots, which are also edible, are good sources of vitamins A, C and B (Riboflavin) </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>The darker-fleshed varieties contain very high levels of beta-carotene (a precursor to vitamin A) . Just 125g of fresh roots from most orange-fleshed varieties can provide the daily pro-vitamin A needs of a preschooler. This is particularly important in Sub Saharan Africa and Asia where vitamin A deficiency is a leading cause of blindness, disease and premature death among children under five and pregnant women. </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Most recently nutritionists have also begun exploring the potential cancer preventing properties of the purple fleshed sweetpotato varieties, which contain easily absorbed anthocyanins, known to be powerful antioxidants.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Biofortifcation, where scientists add nutritional value to staple crops through breeding, is an effective strategy for improving health in  poor communities where people cannot afford commercially fortified foods and vitamin supplements. </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>At the International Potato Center’s Quality and Nutrition laboratory, researchers are dedicated to continuously screening the many varieties in the Center’s sweetpotato collection. They use cutting edge technology to evaluate and characterize nutrient levels and identify the varieties most useful to national sweetpotato breeding programs, to produce locally adapted varieties with high nutritional content. </span></p>
