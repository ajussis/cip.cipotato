<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.9461490625981241">Sweetpotatoes are good sources of carbohydrates, fiber, and many micronutrients. They produce more edible energy per hectare per day than wheat, rice or cassava. The leaves and shoots, which are also edible, are good sources of vitamins A, C, and B (Riboflavin).</span><br /><span></span><br /><span><img alt="Sweetpotato nutrition" class="image-right" height="259" src="macronutrientsweetpotato.jpg/image_preview" />The darker-fleshed varieties contain very high levels of beta-carotene (a precursor to vitamin A). Just 125 g of fresh roots from most orange-fleshed varieties can provide the daily pro-vitamin A needs of a preschooler. This is particularly important in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia where vitamin A deficiency is a leading cause of blindness, disease, and premature death among children under five and pregnant women. </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Most recently nutritionists have also begun exploring the potential cancer preventing properties of the purple fleshed sweetpotato varieties, which contain easily absorbed anthocyanins, known to be powerful antioxidants.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Biofortifcation, where scientists add nutritional value to staple crops through breeding, is an effective strategy for improving health in poor communities where people cannot afford commercially fortified foods and vitamin supplements. </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Researchers at the Quality and Nutrition Lab continuously screen the many varieties in CIPâ€™s sweetpotato collection. They use cutting-edge technology to evaluate and characterize nutrient levels and identify the varieties most useful to national sweetpotato breeding programs for distribution to local farmers.</span></p>
