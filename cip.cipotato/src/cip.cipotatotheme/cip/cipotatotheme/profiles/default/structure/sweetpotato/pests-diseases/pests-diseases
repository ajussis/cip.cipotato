<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.007881521480157971">Although the crop can be produced under difficult growing conditions with minimum inputs, weevils and other nematode and insect pests continue to plague sweetpotato production despite the use - and misuse - of insecticides.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>The best strategy to counter these threats starts with host plant resistance. As well as breeding for resistance, CIP researchers develop and promote </span><span>integrated pest management (IPM) </span><span>techniques to increase yields and reduce farmers’ dependence on expensive and harmful pesticides. </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Some of sweetpotato’s enemies</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Sweetpotato weevil</span><span> is the most important sweetpotato pest in the world and is a major source of economic loss in developing countries. Attacking all parts of the plant, adults feed directly on vines; larvae tunnel into the roots, causing extensive damage both in field and storage. </span><br /><span>Different species prevail in different parts of the world. </span><span>Euscepes postfasciatus </span><span>occurs in South America and a few other places. </span><span>Cylas fornicarius </span><span>is present in the Caribbean, southern United States, and Asia. The African species </span><span>Cylas puncticollis</span><span> and </span><span>C. brunneus </span><span>are restricted to sub-Saharan Africa </span><span>(pic)</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Sweetpotato root knot nematode</span><span> </span><span>Meloidogyne spp </span><span>is one of the major known nematode pests of sweetpotato in the tropics. It attacks fibers and roots, allowing other pathogens to penetrate the plant through the wounds. </span><span>(pic)</span><span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Whitefly</span><br /><span>Whiteflies are widely distributed pests of many agricultural crops and ornamental plants. The species, </span><span>Bemisia tabaci,</span><span> is a particularly serious pest of sweetpotato. </span><span>(pic)</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Link </span><br /><span>Attract and kill (topics file)</span><br /><span>Integrated pest management</span></p>
