<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.9461490625981241">Although the crop can be produced under difficult growing conditions, weevils and other nematode and insect pests continue to plague sweetpotato production despite the use - and misuse - of insecticides.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>The best strategy to counter these threats starts with host plant resistance. As well as breeding for resistance, CIP researchers develop and promote integrated pest management (IPM) techniques to increase yields and reduce farmers’ dependence on expensive and harmful pesticides. </span><br /><span></span><br /><b><span>Some of sweetpotato’s enemies</span></b><br /><span></span><br /><span>Sweetpotato weevil is the most important sweetpotato pest in the world and is a major source of economic loss in developing countries. Attacking all parts of the plant, adults feed directly on vines; larvae tunnel into the roots, causing extensive damage both in field and storage. </span></p>
<p><span>Different species prevail in different parts of the world. <i>Euscepes postfasciatus </i>occurs in South America and a few other places. <i>Cylas fornicarius </i>is present in the Caribbean, southern United States, and Asia. The African species <i>Cylas puncticollis </i>and <i>C. brunneus</i> are restricted to Sub-Saharan Africa. (pic)</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Sweetpotato root knot nematode <i>Meloidogyne spp</i> is one of the major known nematode pests of sweetpotato in the tropics. It attacks fibers and roots, allowing other pathogens to penetrate the plant through the wounds. (pic)</span><br /><span></span></p>
<p><span>Whitefly is a widely distributed pest of many agricultural crops and ornamental plants. The species <i>Bemisia tabaci </i>is a particularly serious pest of sweetpotato. (pic)</span></p>
