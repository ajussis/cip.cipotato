<p><span>Sweetpotato is the world’s sixth most important food crop. First domesticated more than 5000 years ago, it is grown in more developing countries than any other root crop.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Despite its name, sweetpotato is not related to the potato. It is a root not a tuber. Many parts of the plant are edible, including roots and vines, and varieties exist with a wide range of skin and flesh color, from white through to yellow-orange and deep purple.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The crop is easy to grow and, requiring little labor and chemical fertilizers, is a cheap and nutritious solution for developing countries needing to grow more food on less area for rapidly multiplying populations. It also provides inexpensive high protein animal fodder.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>CIP’s extensive sweetpotato collection contains over 8000 accessions (about a thousand of which are wild) from all over the Americas, Asia and Africa. </span></p>
